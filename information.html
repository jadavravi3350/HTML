    <hr><h3>(1)=WEBSITE</h3>
    <hr><u>[A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is
      identified
      by a
      common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular
      topic
      or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking. Hyperlinking between web
      pages
      guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. As of December 2022, the top 5 most
      visited
      websites are Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.]</u>

      (HTTP).]</u>

  <p><h3>(3)= CLIENT SERVER</h3>
    <hr><u>[What is client-server? Client-server is a relationship in which one program, the client, requests a
      service
      or
      resource from another program, the server. The label client-server was previously used to distinguish
      distributed
      computing by PCs from the monolithic, centralized computing model used by mainframes.]</u>
  </p>
  <hr>

  <p><h3>(4)=DOMAIN</h3>
    <hr><u>[In the Internet, a domain name is a string that identifies a realm of administrative autonomy, authority
      or
      control. Domain names are often used to identify services provided through the Internet, such as websites,
      email
      services and more. As of 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.[1] Domain names are used in
      various
      networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name
      identifies a network domain or an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access
      the
      Internet, or a server computer.]</u>
  </p>
  <hr>

  <P><h3>(5)=HOST</h3>
    <hr><u>[A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Also known as
      network
      website or web service to be globally accessible from the Internet.]</u>

  </P>
  <hr>

  <p><h3>(6)=HOSTING</h3>
    <hr><u>[Hosting, in its most generic sense, is a service through which storage and computing resources are
      providing
      to
      an individual or organization for the accommodation and maintenance of one or more websites and related
      services.
      While hosting doesn’t need to be IP-based, the vast majority of instances are web-based services that allow a
      website or web service to be globally accessible from the Internet.]</u>

  </p>
  <hr>

  <p><h3>(7)=FTP</h3>
    <hr><u>(i)[FTP FULL FORM IS:-- FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL]<br><br>(ii)[The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a
      standard
      communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer
      network.
      FTP
      is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client
      and
      the server.]</ul>
  </p>
  <hr>

  <p><h3>(8)=PATH</h3>
    <hr><u>[Alternatively known as the pathname, the current path or path is the complete location or name of where
      a
      computer, file, device, or web page is located. Below are examples of different types of computer-related
      paths.]</u>
    <hr>
  </p>

  <p><h3>(9)=EXTENSION</h3>
    <hr><u>[An extension, in computer operating systems, is a piece of software that enhances or “extends” the
      capabilities
      of a programming language or other applications. An extension adds extra features to an already working
      standalone
      application. Usually an extension itself is not independently functional and needs other software with which
      to
      work.]</u>
    <hr>
  </p>

  <p><h3>(10)= EDITOR / VSCODE</h3>
    <hr><u>[At its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common
      user
      interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and
      an
      editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.]</u>

    <hr>
  </p>
  <p><h3>(11)=URI - URL / URN</h3>
    <hr><u>[(i) URI ->(Uniform Resource Identifier) is a formal system for uniquely identifying resources and
      consists
      of
      two
      types: .<br>

      (ii) URL ->(Uniform Resource Locator) also known as a web address, identifies a web resource as well as its
      location
      on a computer network and how
      to access it (e.g. http://www.library.pitt.edu).<br>

      (iii) URN ->(Uniform Resource Name) is a formal naming scheme that identifies a resource, but does not
      indicate
      its
      location or how to access it
      (e.g. ISBN, ISSN).]</u><br>
    <hr>
  </p>

  <p><h3>(12)= ADDRESS BAR</h3>
    <HR><u>[In a web browser, the address bar (also location bar or URL bar) is the element that shows the current
      URL.
      The
      user can type a URL into it to navigate to a chosen website. In most modern browsers, non-URLs are
      automatically
      sent to a search engine. In a file browser, it serves the same purpose of navigation, but through the
      file-system
      hierarchy.

      Many address bars offer features like autocomplete and a list of suggestions while the address is being typed
      in.
      This auto-completion feature bases its suggestions on the browser's history. Some browsers have keyboard
      shortcuts
      to auto-complete an address.]</u>

  </p>
  <p><h3>(13)= TITLE BAR</h3>
    <hr><u>[The title bar is a horizontal bar located at the top of a window in a GUI. It displays the title of the
      software, name of the current document or file, or other text identifying the contents of that window. For
      example,
      in the picture below, the title bar displays the program name "TextPad" and the document name "Document1" that
      is
      currently being edited.]</u>
